Examples:

Atomic schedulers:

   1) Exact time of day

            HH:mm[:ss]

      HH - hours  : 00 .. 23
      mm - minutes: 00 .. 59
      ss - seconds: 00 .. 59
      [] - content in [] is not mandatory

   2) Periodic run task every fixed duration (N1) after pause, if specified, in fixed duration (N2)

            repeat every N1 sec|min|hour [after pause in N2 sec|min|hour]

      N1, N2 - positive integer numbers
      [] - content in [] is not mandatory

   3) Period of time with fixed run every fixed time

      from HH:mm[:ss] to HH:mm[:ss] every N sec|min|hour

   4) Simple period of time in day. It can be used only with cooperation with another schedulers

      from HH:mm[:ss] to HH:mm[:ss]

   5) Day of week

      sunday|monday|tuesday|wednesday|thursday|friday|saturday

    6) Months, days of month and years

      Examples:

      1..10 mart april

          It is means: from 1 to 10 mart or april

      1 5 7 october

          It is means: 1st, 5th or 7th october

      You can combine ranges and simple numbers of months:

      1 3 10..20 september

          It is means: 1st, 3d or from 10th to 20th of the september

      You can use ranges for months:

      17 september..december

          It is means: 17th of the september or of the october or of the november or of the december

      If you want to define some number of any month you can do it like:

      17 jan..dec

          It is means: 17th of any month

      You can also define years, for example:

      2000 2005 2010..2017 years

      It is means: In any year from the: 2000 2005 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017

      And you can combine years with months, for example:

      1 april 2007 2011 year

           It is means: The first of the april in 2007 or in 2011 years


Scheduler combinations

   Some schedulers can be combined with two operator: plus `+` and multiply `*`. Multiply is more harder then plus.
   To exactly determine order of operation you can use square brackets, for example:

      from 8:00 to 18:00 every 1 hour * (mon + tue + wed + thu + fri) * (2011..2020 years)
